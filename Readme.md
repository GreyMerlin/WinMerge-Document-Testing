#### 07 March 2018 ...

- Here is a *very-early* sample of what the first four pages of the current WinMerge User Help (for 2.15.3) looks like after conversion from **DocBook** to **Markdown**.  Indeed ... I have proposed to convert this material to **Doxygen**, but I have chosen this as a useful (or at least an *interesting*) intermediate step in that conversion.

    Please note that I have **not** (intentionally) made any textual changes to these pages.  Yes ... they are in serious need of modernization, but that will take place after the toolchain and formatting issues are settled.

    If you have any coments on this conversion so far, you can add a comment to the [WinMerge Issue #88 - Modernize User Manual]( https://bitbucket.org/winmerge/winmerge/issues/88/modernize-user-manual-for-215x-and-beyond) proposal at BitBucket.org.

    [**WinMerge Help**](./Docs/Users-English/Manual/WinMerge_help.md)

- For comparison, here are the exactly identical four pages **directly** from the current **2.15.3** web-based WinMerge help pages.

    [**Index**](./Build/Manual/html/index.html) - also the root page of the entire web-based help

    [**About Doc**](./Build/Manual/html/About_Doc.html)

    [**Quick Start**](./Build/Manual/html/Quick_start.html) 

    [**Introduction**](./Build/Manual/html/Introduction.html)

- I refrain from making any 'value judgement' statements on this page.  However, see my comments at [WinMerge Issue #88 - Modernize User Manual]( https://bitbucket.org/winmerge/winmerge/issues/88/modernize-user-manual-for-215x-and-beyond)

- This is a **Temporary** repo. If you feel inclined to make a fork, please keep in mind that I ***will*** eventually delete the entire repo.
