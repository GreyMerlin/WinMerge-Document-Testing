         <p>WinMerge is an <a class="ulink" href="http://www.opensource.org/" target="_top">Open
                 Source</a> differencing and merging tool for Windows. WinMerge can compare
              both folders and files, presenting differences in a visual text format that is
              easy to understand and handle.
         </p>
         <p>WinMerge is highly useful for determining what has changed between
              project versions, and then merging changes between versions. WinMerge can be
              used as an external differencing/merging tool or as a standalone
              application.
         </p>
         <p>In addition, WinMerge has many helpful supporting features that make
              comparing, synchronising, and merging as easy and useful as possible. Several
              programming languages and other file formats are syntax-highlighted.
         </p>
         <p>WinMerge is not a hex editor. WinMerge can show binary files contents
              and differences between them. But the information is meant for viewing only:
              editing binary files with WinMerge can break the files.
         </p>
         <p>The goal of WinMerge development is to make comparing, synchronizing,
              and merging folders and files easy and fast, while maintaining maximum
              reliability. Ease of use is of key importance for reducing errors. The latest
              version, <span><a name="version"></a>2.16</span> is
              considered a stable and reliable program to use.
         </p>
         <p>Please note that WinMerge is not freeware (as many sites on the Web have
              stated): it is <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_top">GPL</a> licensed. We
              provide you with a good tool for free, so please honor your license agreement

              the advantage of all WinMerge users.

                        improvements made after last stable version. Beta versions are not tested
                        as extensively as stable versions and probably have some bugs. Beta
                        versions have an odd second number, for example 2.5 and 2.7. Beta versions
                        can be used in production, because they are not expected to have major
                        bugs. But there is always a risk with using beta-level releases, so
                        consider it carefully. We have tried to release a new stable series once a
                        year, so it may be worth waiting for few months for the next stable
                        release...

                        create new branches for stable releases. In the diagram, the arrows for
                        2.4.x and 2.6.x versions are two current stable branches. (The diagram is

                           <p>A branch always indicates a separate development effort. There is
                                      no any automation to copy improvements or fixes from development
                                      versions to stable versions, or in the opposite direction. Changes are
                                      always selected by hand and then merged (using WinMerge, of
                                      course).

               </div>
               <p>After a branch is created, we try to keep the code in it as stable
                        as possible. Usually this means that we copy only tested bug fixes from
                        development versions to stable versions. Unfortunately this is not always
                        an easy task, and errors can occur. New bugs can also appear in stable
                        versions: this is real-life software development. However, in general,
                        quality increases in branches. For example, 2.6.14 was a better release
                        than 2.4.0. So we always recommend using the latest stable branch
                        release.
               </p>
               <p>This branching also means that stable versions don't get many new
                        features after a branch is created. Stable versions 2.6.0 and 2.6.14 had
                        pretty similar features. After the 2.6 stable branch, we created a new
                        stable branch, 2.8, where we added many improvements and fixes.
               </p>
               <p>Many software vendors always increase their version numbers and
                        advise people to use the version with the biggest number. If WinMerge were
                        developed as proprietary software, users would see only versions from
                        stable branches. But because WinMerge is an open source software project,
                        we want to keep our development as open as possible and to release many
                        development versions. The latest development version can have version
                        number 2.9.1.0 and the latest stable version can be version 2.6.14.
