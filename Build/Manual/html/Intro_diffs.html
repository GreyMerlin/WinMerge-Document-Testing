         <p>This topic describes how WinMerge detects and displays differences
              within text files, and demonstrates simple file comparing and merging
              operations. See <a class="xref" href="Intro_diffs.html" title="Overview of file comparing and merging">Overview of file comparing and merging</a> for related information about
              hex files.

            <p>We usually compare two files that are related in some way, such as two
               versions that were edited at different times, or by different people. If you
               examine two such files you can usually see some similar areas, and also
                 identify several types of differences: different characters and words,
                   different lines, even entire blocks of text that are different. But trying
                   to understanding all the differences between two files by scanning them in
                   your favorite editor can be tedious and error-prone. Specialized
                   difference/merging tools like WinMerge are designed make this work more
                   systematic and efficient.
            </p>
            <p>A simple difference utility that most people have used is a spell
                   checker: it systematically steps you through a document, highlights words
                   that are different from those in its dictionary, and helps you resolve each
                   spelling problem. However, looking only at characters and words is not an
                   effective way to understand differences between multiple files. For this
                   reason, many difference utilities use lines as the basic unit of comparison
                   instead.
            </p>
            <p>WinMerge also uses lines as its basic unit of difference. Words and
                   characters are not treated individually in comparing and merging operations.
                   To illustrate, consider two files that are identical except for one line
                   that is different. If the two versions of the line have four words that are
                   different and one version has an extra space, then we say that the file has
                   one difference, not five.
            </p>
            <p>If it's quicker to compare lines than words, sometimes it's also
                   useful to treat an entire block of lines as a single difference, instead of
                   comparing one line at a time. As we will see later, detecting multiple-line
                   differences makes merging more efficient too.

                     <li>
                        <p>Start WinMerge. For example, double-click the <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="screenshots/wm_icon.png" width="32" alt="WinMerge desktop shortcut"></span> WinMerge desktop shortcut.
                        </p>

                     <li>
                        <p>In the Select Files and Folders dialog, specify

                              <dd>
                                 <p>Difference blocks are marked with the difference
                                                    background color (gold, by default).
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Line differences can be enabled to mark changed text
                                                    within differences blocks, using the word background color
                                                    (light yellow, by default).

                                 <p>Identical lines are unmarked: they have white backgrounds,
                                                    like the third line in the example.
                                 </p>

                                 <p>Notice that in the left comparison pane, the second line
                                                    has text: the other pane has a blank gray line in the same
                                                    location. This blank line does not exist in the
                                                    <code class="filename">File2</code> source file, so what is it doing in
                                                    WinMerge?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>WinMerge inserts one or more gray blank lines in one
                                                    version of a difference when the other version has more lines.
                                                    These empty gray lines do not represent blank lines in the
                                                    source file; they are only placeholders in the display. The
                                                    purpose of placeholder lines is to keep the left and right
                                                    versions of differences vertically aligned. Thus in our example,
                                                    the text, <code class="computeroutput">WinMerge compares
                                                       lines</code>, appears side by side in the Comparison
                                                    window, even though they are on different lines in the source
                                                    files. This makes it easier to compare differences in WinMerge
                                                    than in a conventional editor.

                   operation: please read the preceding section before beginning this section.
                   In addition to detecting differences between two file versions, we resolve
                   the differences and save the result in a single
                   <em class="glossterm">target</em> version.
            </p>
            <p>Merging files makes concurrent development possible, and it is a
                   common task in team environments. For example, suppose you and another
                   person want to add code to the same program file at the same time. You both
                   begin with an identical copy of the file, but during development you create
                   separate versions that are not identical. At some point, the two versions
                   must be merged into one version that preserves the changes from each
                   contributor.
            </p>
            <p>Merging can be prompted (or even initiated) by version control systems
                   like Subversion and ClearCase. For example, your version control system
                   might prevent you from submitting changes to its repository because of merge
                   conflicts. A conflict can occur if someone else checked in a different
                   version of the same file while you were working on your version, and the
                   version control system was not able to automatically merge the differences.
                   When that happens, you might need to merge the conflicting versions before
                   trying again to contribute your version. Many systems have integrated
                   difference and merge tools, but you might prefer to use WinMerge
                   instead.
            </p>
            <p>Just as with comparing, you use WinMerge's toolbar controls (or
                   keyboard shortcuts) to systematically step through the differences. Resolve
                   each difference by copying either its left or right
                   <em class="glossterm">candidate</em> to the other side. When you have resolved
                   all the differences, WinMerge lets you know that all differences are
                   resolved (the versions are identical), and you are done merging.

               <p>While very simple, this example demonstrates a basic methodology
                        that you can use to step through a comparison of any length, merging each
                        difference one by one until you have the result that you want.

               <p>You control where your merge result is preserved. The WinMerge File
                        Compare window does not have a separate result pane, as some merge tools
                        do. So the simplest strategy is to save your changes to one or both source
                        files. Press <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>S</strong></span> at any time to save the current changes to both files;
                        alternatively, click <span class="guimenu">File</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Save Left</span> or <span class="guimenu">File</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Save Right</span> to save only one file.
               </p>
               <p>To write to a third file instead of either source file, use
                        <span class="guimenu">File</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Save As</span>. For example, your target file might be the difference or
                        conflict file generated by a version control system.
               </p>
               <p>Similarly, in the WinMerge command line, you can leave both source
                        versions unchanged by using the optional <code class="option">outputfile</code>
                        argument, as described in <a class="xref" href="Command_line.html" title="Command line">Command line</a>.
